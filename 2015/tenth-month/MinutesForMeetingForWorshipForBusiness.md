1.  Silence followed by queries.

    Integrity section of advices from *IMYM Faith and Practice*

        Our witness is most effective when we are in contact with the Spirit
        within. Each of us has a particular experience of God; each must find
        the ways to be true to it.

2.  **Consideration of ninth month minutes** - please look at the minutes
    (*attached* and) online at:

3.  **New Business:**

    **Proposal to establish a regular social time at the rise of
    meeting** - [Holly][HollyGrasso] has brought forward this idea. Let us at least
    begin a discussion about the value of integrating such a social
    period into our usual meeting schedule, and how it might be handled
    logistically.

    For the next few months, we will try out having 20 minutes or so of
    hospitality and conversation at the rise of meeting. [Holly Grasso][HollyGrasso] will
    be in charge of providing more robust offerings. In a few months, we
    will revisit this to see how it is going. We are grateful to [Holly][HollyGrasso] for
    bringing this to the meeting.

   **Thoughts on Quaker Quest**, and the way forward to continue to
    internally grow?

    It is the feeling of M&O is that we should have a threshing session to
    unpack and process our experience and determine our direction. We had
    a long discussion about setting up a threshing session. [Lisa Lister][LisaLister]
    will send out a survey when several choices of time for November. We
    will move our Soup and Sharing gathering to December. The topic of the
    Soup and Sharing will remain Vocal Ministry and will be held at [Lisa][LisaLister]
    and [Phil][PhilFriesen]'s house.
