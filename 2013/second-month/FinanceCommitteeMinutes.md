Finance Committee Minutes
=========================
February 12-15, 2013 

Present: Sarah Callbeck (clerk), Ann Daugherty (treasurer).  Julie could not be present. 
We had an e-meeting.


We reviewed the cash flow, focusing particularly on the utilities bill 
and checking account balance.  

Utility cost was again up significantly in January due to increased usage 
of electricity and gas.  The billing period was from December 10th to 
January 10th, prior to installation of the new furnace and taping the 
baseboard heater controls to allow the thermostat to do its job of maintaining 
a balmy 50 degrees in the restrooms. 

ENT checking has declined to $795.  A "Very Basic Cash Flow" has been prepared 
and distributed with the usual cash flow report.  It details revenue from 
pledged donations, basic expenses we must pay each month, and the resultant 
monthly decline of the checking account.  We ask the Meeting to carefully consider 
this document and the implications it has on our ability to meet other obligations
(assessments) and fund programs (disbursements to other organizations, 
scholarships to IMYM, website hosting, etc.).  We do have some reserves to cover 
mortgage and utilities, but they will last less than three months should we need to 
draw on them.


The State has acknowledged receipt of our religious exemption application.  We 
now await the granting of the exemption, but will pay the property tax bill by 
April 1st if it has not yet arrived.  


In the Light,
Sarah Callbeck
Finance Committee Clerk
