Meeting House Committee
=======================
February 13, 2013

Attendance:  Ann Daugherty, clerk; Molly Wingate; Daniel Kidney

Continuing projects:
	Electrician:  Ann Daugherty will arrange for the electrician to return to the meeting house
			Inspect wiring in the attic
			Install ceiling fans
			Install second switch and rheostat for overhead lights, if possible
			Advise about the safety of the outside light fixtures
			Advise and install motion sensors that are independent of indoor lighting
	
Insulate attic: Once the electrician is finished in the attic,   Molly will arrange for 
insulation to be put in the attic.  We have a bid of $1,100.

Other projects:
 *. Privacy fence on west side of the building: Daniel will arrange for it to be removed and replaced.
    He roughly estimates that $300 will be ample to move and replace the fence, dig new post holes, 
    and put in a gate.  We ask that the finance committee set $300 aside in the building fund, 
    if possible.

 *. Refurbish and clean the new chairs: 
    We wish to clean and repaint at as necessary the metal frames of the chairs.
    We suggest that we use a rug and furniture shampooing machine to clean the 
    fabric of all the chairs.  We can rent one if no one has one to lend.  

 *. We will look for replacement plastic caps for the frame tubing.
    Molly knows two students who are looking for community service projects 
    and might be able to do some of this work. 	

 *. Opening upper sashes of the large windows:  When the weather is warmer, we will 
    further investigate opening the upper sashes of the windows.  This would greatly 
    improve our temperature control in the summer.  

 *. Screens for the windows:  When Ann cleaned out the storage closet, she discovered more screens.  
    We suggest cleaning and repainting the existing screens and finding additional, adjustable screens.

Other topics:
We discussed buying a set of room screens to block cold air coming in the back door when people 
enter that way.  The screens would also visually block the back door.  Molly has seen some simple, 
Arts and Crafts style, pine and paper screens for $50 each. To try to keep our simple visual lines 
balanced, the screens should come into the worship room as far as the foyer does.  It would be an 
expense of approximately $100. We ask for Friends input and the input from the Finance Committee.

Discussed the front door and door sill.  Eventually we suggest replacing both.  The door sill shows 
signs of rot and the front doors are not lovely.  We are happy to hear suggestions and ideas for this 
long term project.

Molly shared the latest version of the fundraising letter which she plans to get out soon with 
the help of Sarah Callbeck.

Warm weather workday projects:
	Landscaping/irrigation plan
	Replace the fence
	Open the upper window sashes

In the Light,
