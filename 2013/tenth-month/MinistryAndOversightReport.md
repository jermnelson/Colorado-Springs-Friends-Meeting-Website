# Ministry and Oversight Committee
## September 23, 2013

Present: [Peter LeVar][PeterLeVar], [Linda Seger][LindaSeger], [Martha Lutz][MarthaLutz], and 
[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], Clerk. Absent, [Carlton Gamer][CarltonGamer].

We began about 3:15 with Spiritual Silence and a brief check-in.
[Peter][PeterLeVar] and [Linda][LindaSeger] reported that 
[Jonathan McPhee][JonathanMcPhee] is has some struggles but overall is doing 
satisfactorily after being released from incarceration. We noted that 
[Kathy Ide][KathyIde] has attended Meeting for Worship recently and is doing 
well but still in hospice. We reviewed the specifics of a recent request for 
emergency funds that  later  was retracted. Most of our meeting was spent on 
discussing this experience and individual contributions to it. We agreed that the 
traditional Quaker process of discernment was clouded by having to make a hasty decision. 
Future meetings will focus on developing a process for disbursing emergency funds.

We will continue to make our yearly Quaker calls to Members and Attenders. We 
are encouraged to make note of how we can support a Friend’s physical and spiritual
life. One important aspect of the calls will be to invite Friends to consider how 
they can contribute to the Meeting.

We closed in silence about 4:30. Our next meeting will be October 21st.

In the Light,

[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], clerk
