Ministry and Oversight Committee, Feb. 25, 2013
-----------------------------------------------
Minutes

Present: Carlton Gamer, Martha Lutz, Linda Seger, and Ann Grant Martin, clerk.

We opened with a Spiritual Silence a little after 3:00 PM.
We received a report from Ann Martin about both Jonathan McPhee who is 
incarcerated and Kathy Ide who has pancreatic cancer. They are in good spirits 
and dealing with their respective challenges. Both have times of discouragement, 
but overall are carrying on life with a positive outlook.

Martha Lutz is going to season her opportunity to correspond with an 
incarcerated man in Canon City.

It was the sense of the meeting to proceed with creating information cards for 
visitors that will be placed on the chairs. Ann Martin will get the cards 
printed. On one side will be text from our Quaker Poster and the other side 
will give information taken from Intermountain Faith and Practice about speaking 
in Meeting.

Martha Lutz will speak with Ann Daugherty about obtaining a plastic brochure box 
to hold Meeting brochures. The intent is to place the box outside for people 
passing by to get information about our Meeting.

We welcome Julie Roten-Valdez to our Ministry and Oversight Committee.

There has been interest expressed in having Meeting for Worship one evening a 
month. We suggest either a Tuesday or Wednesday at 6:00 PM during the first 
week of the month. Ann Martin will send out an email to query about the 
interest of members and attenders.

Having an evening of Worship Sharing was approved at the February Business 
Meeting. We will have a Meeting for Worship Sharing on March 20th at 6:30 
in our Meeting House. The topic is "How do we practice Stewardship in our daily 
lives?" We ask Friends to bring snacks to share for a social time afterward.

It has been requested that the Ministry and Oversight Committee write the 2013 
State of the Meeting Report. We will write the report as a committee and have 
it completed in time for Colorado Regional on April 28. Carlton will total the 
number of members and attenders we have. Martha will get information about the 
First Day School. Ann will list the special events we have had in the past year 
and find out who of our Meeting's friends serve on committees in the greater 
Quaker Community. We will complete our preliminary research by March 11.

We agreed to delay our Friendly calls to members and consistent attenders until May.

We closed at about 4:30 PM in Silence.

In the Light,                   
Ann Grant Martin
