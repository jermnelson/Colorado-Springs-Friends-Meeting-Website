We opened with spiritual silence at 3:20 PM. After a brief check-in we 
reviewed July's minutes and were satisfied that we had addressed all of the 
issues discussed in July.

We continued with our main agenda item of formulating Quakerly questions to 
used to inspire conversation for our yearly Quaker visits and/or calls to 
members and attenders of our meeting.  We felt that it is important to begin 
each conversation with assurance that it is the Ministry and Oversight 
Committee's custom to contact Friends once a year to speak to their spiritual 
needs. The following questions are suggested ways of inspiring authentic dialog. 
It is unlikely that all of the questions would be used in any one conversation.

1.  Is the Meeting, satisfying your spiritual needs? 

1.  Does our Meeting nourish and nurture your spiritual life? 

1.  Do you seek other spiritual guidance?

1.  Does the vocal ministry during our Meetings for Worship speak to your condition?

1.  Is there anything that interferes with your spiritual life?

1.  Are there challenges in your life or spiritual life that we can help you with? 
    Would a Clearness Committee be of help?

1.  How do you feel about the various programs we have?

1.  Do you have talents that you would be willing to share with the Meeting. 

Following the determination of the Quakerly questions, members of M&O 
volunteered to make contact with specific Friends. We also agreed that we will 
act as a group to experience the Ministry of the M&O Committee.

We closed with Silence at about 4:40 PM.

In the Light,     

[Ann Grant Martin][AnnGrantMartin], Clerk
