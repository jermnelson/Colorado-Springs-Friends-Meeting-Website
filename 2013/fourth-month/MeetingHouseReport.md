# Meeting House Committee
## April 11, 2013
Attendance:  [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty], clerk; [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate]

Old Business:
Thanks to everyone who helped install our new fence (especially [Daniel][DanielKidney] 
who found such an economical way to do it) and everyone who helped paint 
the classroom walls.  

We are in conversation with the Fountain Valley Electric to determine how many 
ceiling fans we need.  Once we have the fans installed, we will finish the capital 
project by installing insulation in the ceiling.  We believe we have the money on 
hand in the building fund to complete this project, but will check with finance 
committee before we sign any contracts.

Exemption on property taxes:  [Ann][AnnDaugherty] learned that our 
application to be exempt is under consideration.  She will talk with 
the treasurer's office to find out if we have to pay our current bill 
as we await a final determination or if we can wait without incurring penalties.

Renting the building:  We have had one group rent our building for half of a 
day. They generously paid us $80. [Bill Werling][BillWerling] has drafted a 
rental agreement for our use.  [Molly Wingate][MollyWingate] is reviewing it 
with Brian Murphy, our attorney.  We hope to attract more groups.

Fund Raising Letter:  We have raised $850 from private donations to the meeting 
house this calendar year and use some of it to purchase our chairs. 
[Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty] is drafting a thank you note for all of us the sign 
to each person.

New Business:

  We created a prioritized list of maintenance and improvement projects

  1. Fans, electric wiring for the fans, and a rheostat for overheard lights
  1. Insulation in the attic
  1. Stain the new fence 
  1. Spruce up our window screens and acquire a few more
  1. Landscaping - get control of the dirt.  ([Deneen Crandall][Deneen Crandall] 
     mentioned that she might be able to come up with a design.
     [Martha Lutz][MarthaLutz] said she would be happy to do the planting,
     supplying the tools and maybe some extra labor.)
  1. Room Screens to screen the back door 

Ministry and Oversight has requested that we have our brochures available to 
passersby in a box on a stand.  [Ann Daugherty][AnnDaugherty] will look into 
buying the kind of thing that realtors use and report back.  This will be a 
building fund expense. 

We closed in silence.

Respectfully submitted,

[Molly Wingate][MollyWingate]
