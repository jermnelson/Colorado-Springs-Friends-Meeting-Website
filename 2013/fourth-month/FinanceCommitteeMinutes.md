Finance Committee Minutes
April 16, 2013 

Present: [Sarah Callbeck] (clerk), [Julie Roten-Valdez] (recording clerk) and 
[Ann Daugherty] (treasurer).  We met at Julie's office. 


[Ann] said our religious exemption application with the state is still pending.  
The property tax bill has not been paid because Ann has confirmed that, 
according to statute, we don't need to do so (no penalties will be incurred) 
unless our application is denied.  We will continue to hold funds for the tax in 
reserve until a final determination is received.

Ann also updated us on the electrical system, including the cost of ceiling fans.  
We await the results of an airflow study to determine the number of fans needed and a quote from Fountain Valley Electrical before deciding if we have sufficient funds to proceed.

We reviewed the cash flow report noting that:
1. While the checking balance appears a little higher than last month, there is within it $600 designated for building projects that has yet to be moved to savings, which would leave a balance of $214.73
2. Utilities for March were $219.86.  As of April, we are on budget billing at $180/month.  Actual usage on the April bill is $166.33, indicating that our new systems are doing their job.  Mother Nature is helping, also, with some warmer weather.  
3. IMYM scholarships were covered by a designated donation and excess reserves from assessment reserves - an over-reserve 
  and funds reserved for four members who had withdrawn their membership prior 
  to January 1st of this year.  We offer our gratitude to M&O for clarifying the 
  membership status of those individuals, enabling the re-purpose of funds. 
4. The emergency fund is a little below $500, but will suffice for now.
5. The insurance reserve decreased due to paying the premium for the current year.
6. The mortgage and utilities reserve is 38% of the 6 month reserve we would like to have.  We will begin drawing on it this month.

This month, we will pay the $100 donation for camperships pledged last year to Mountain Friends Camp.  

We briefly discussed receiving rent, as Ann noted we had been given $80 by a group who used our meeting house for several hours.  Funds paid to the Meeting as rent, backed by an agreed amount and a rental agreement, will be subject to tax since renting space is outside our purpose as a religious organization.  Any rents received will require a certain amount to be reserved for tax.  Sarah will research the tax rate and filing requirements.

Next we reviewed a graph of "Expense vs Income: Then & Now" (to be distributed at business meeting by the Clerk).  Our total operating cost is $1,170/month, and our total operating income (pledge donations) is $703/month, a shortfall of $467.  The Finance Committee asks members and attenders, including those who have pledged, to consider whether they can increase their contribution.

Financial statements are in process and will be available for business meeting.

Sarah will prepare assessment letters for mailing at the end of this month.

In the Light,
Sarah Callbeck
Finance Committee Clerk
