STATE OF THE MEETING REPORT for 2011

For Colorado Springs Friends Meeting

Colorado Springs, Colorado

April, 2012

 

The Colorado Springs Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends prospers in the Light of Truth.  Our regular attendance remains steadily between 12 and 20 members and attenders each week with a vibrantly engaged cohort of 7-9 young Friends in our First Day program.  We lost two members to death (Memorial minutes to accompany this report) and one member transferred membership to Kapiti Meeting in New Zealand.  We welcomed a transfer of membership for one member from Salt Lake Meeting.  Our worship time has been enriched by regularly gathered silence out of which Friends have been led to share vocal ministry.  We have welcomed new visitors into our midst, and re-instituted an opportunity for hospitality and conversation at the rise of meeting for worship, which has strengthened the bonds of friendship among us.

Our meeting has determined that separating our Religious Education committee into two distinct committees, a First Day School Committee and the Committee for Adult Education and Social Action, better serves the educational and outreach aspirations of the meeting.  After the success of our First Day School performance project last year, our young Friends have undertaken undertook a video performance project on the stories of the Jesus miracles.  The theme was inspired by a series on depictions of the life of Jesus in art for First Day School in the fall of 2011 by one of our members.  The video recording has been completed and we await the viewing of the edited piece.  Adult Friends have met for an educational series addressing xx.  Other friends have embarked upon a book reading group.  Some among us undertake actions in support with Friends testimonies and convictions, including providing a music ministry to women who are incarcerated, or working to further peace locally, in the Middle East between Palestine and Israel, and along the Mexican US border.  Members and attenders share in the responsibilities for the life of the meeting, serving on committees, as officers and stewards, and in providing care and concern for those struggling with health concern, losses or life transitions.

Our search for a home for our worship was finally brought to a conclusion with the purchase of a meeting house in March of 2011.  The Meeting had considered and pursued other properties and buildings.  Finally, the Way opened when a simple historic church building was put on the market.  The process undertaken by the meeting to review this purchase in the Light of Friends' testimonies and by which we could gain clarity and unity, deepened our trust in the Light and its vitality among us.  We hold in deep gratitude the generosity of many Friends and supporters whose gifts made this purchase possible.  We hope to begin holding worship in our new meeting house in May of 2011 and look forward to welcoming visiting Friends into our new meeting home.  The steadfast efforts of our Meeting Home committee and the Finance Committee guided and supported the Meeting's hope to find a home which would provide us a consistent base from which our Meeting can reach out to our broader community, sharing space, hospitality, and hopefully shining as a living witness to the Light.

Submitted in the Light,

Ginger Morgan, Clerk of the Colorado Springs Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends
