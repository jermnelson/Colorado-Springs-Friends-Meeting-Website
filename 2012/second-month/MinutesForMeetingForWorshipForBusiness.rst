4. Committee Reports:
  a. Finance Committee
    i. Announcement and Recommendation regarding bookkeeping
       In minute `Ann`_'s work has increased when she first volunteered, no longer has time
       increased in amount of work made it difficult to focus and do her job as bookkeeper
       step down until Meeting can find someone to pay to be bookkeeper. In the last round
       of doing financial statements, `Sarah`_ realized that spreadsheets too complicated, 
       recommend using Quickbooks, much simpler, less time, and less money. `Sarah`_ brings forth
       proposal for Meeting to purchase Quickbook Pro 2012, she will set up accounts, current
       cost on Amazon is $135.99 per license. Is Quickbook Pro standard for bookkeepers? Yes,
       there is a non-profit but more expensive than just the straight Quickbook Pro version.
       Very usable, program. Only caveat is that every few years Quicken requires an upgrade.

       `Sarah`_ notified Meeting that she could no longer be bookkeeper but would clerk `Finance
       committee`_ and train `Ann`_ as a bookkeeper. Recommendation that Meeting contract for 
       Bookkeeper services. Budget will need to be reconfigured to reflect new service and Quickbook
       Pro license. Meeting returns matter to Finance committee for purchase Quickbooks and
       look for bookkeeper services. Finance go forward with revised budget and bring to the 
       meeting. Sarah will load 1st quarter into Quickbooks to see how long to generate financial
       reports, some time savings offset cost of software package. Meeting expresses gratitude 
       towards Ann's assistance and `Sarah`_'s continued assistance.

       Finance usually sends out notice about assessments instead of printed letter, will be sending
       out email instead. 

  b. Ministry and Oversight
      Reviewed customary duties of `M&O`_, `Ginger`_ sends email to friends for State of Meeting report. 
      Solicit Friends of meeting feel free to report how their life in the past year has been reflected
      in light of Quaker testimonies. Friends please report quaker engagement 
 
      `Dede`_ time is coming to an end, haven't been able to get an nurse to come. Trying to get a nurse, 
      need to find a nurse and needs hospice care. Molly talked with number of family members, both 
      Sarah and Dede with final requests, family liked that Meeting was a process for after her passing.
      Forms in clerk box? Not sure where location of clerk box, meeting will do search for clerk's box.
      
      Out reach to Jennifer (`Tup`_'s daughter) for memorial with M&O.
 
    i. Transfer of Membership for Deb Gimpelson to `Kapiti Monthly Meeting`_
       `Ginger`_ prepared transfer and Meeting commends transfer to Kapiti Monthly
       Meeting.
       
   ii. Update on charge for proposed `Religious Education and Action Committee`_
       Discussed and ongoing conversation and further seasoning before being before
       Meeting, want to formalize and do something in the light. Bill will accept 
       clerkship with M&O.
      

  c. Meeting Home
     Sent out minutes from Meeting committee, had a deep and meaningful conversation. 
     Assumes $476-500 monthly mortgage with 8% with 5 year balloon payment. Pay down the 
     principal or refinance. FGC will do 15-year mortgage.  

    i. Update on offer on 950 E. Cimmarron
       Interest in next door house, Meeting made an offer, expecting a counter-offer.
       Put some money down with Title company. Once a contract is signed, contact inspectors
       renovation option. How much can we change for how much, administrative overhead, will
       have at least a month to work out. We are anticipating counter-offer. Several stages 
       for Meeting to attend to process $35,000 down, $500 a month mortgage. Financing rate
       and the reminder, seller might carry mortgage. Counter-offer, series of due diligence and
       renovation of first-day space. Will building meet Meeting needs, want inspectors tell 
       us and prudent reserve what we continue to afford, 1 full year of expenses without any
       more contributions. $12,000 towards maintenance and renovation before needing further 
       fundraising. How much renovation can we do before triggering bringing building up to code,
       before we close need other elements in place including renovation and bringing building up to
       code. 

       Building approved original contract, a counter-offer brings new contract. If Ann and Bryan 
       approves counter, meeting approves counter-offer now during Business Meeting. Any concerns 
       about Ginger accepting a counter-offer with counsel, authorizing Clerk. We've been through this
       multiple times, go ahead. If Clerk has reservations, share with Friends through email along with
       expert councils. Clerk will feel quite free to share decision with meeting. Clerk fill confidence 
       of Meeting to go further. Sense of this meeting Clerk in consultation with wise friends and
       affiliated people, will provides with due care about this decision. Past experience has been
       good guide for the Meeting. 

       House next door, Peter and Bill looked for sale. $70,000 is the current offer, owner almost
       sold but that large kitchen, indoor bathroom, garden space. Building in foreclosure, Bill would
       like to find out status of house. Area in Colorado Springs, prices still down.     

  d. Education Committee
     Pending M&O decides about Adult Education and Action separate from 1st day school. Genie agrees
     to be clerk for Adult Education. Sense that things may grow out of learning situation. Larger
     meetings have a program hour, a lot of people stay about various programs. Wondering if program
     hour of interest to the Meeting? Also have a book study? Book study a part of Adult Education 
     bring suggestions to clerk. Martha and John will be getting together to figure out first day
     school programing. Education Committee two items; adult education and first day  

  e. Library
     Nothing to report.

5. Old Business

     Discussed earlier,

     recommendation April potluck to consider FCNL material to meeting annouce discuss at April

6. New Business
  i. Colorado Springs Quakers Website questions
    1. What aspects of the current website (http://coloradospringsquakers.org/) do Friends like?
       Adult education and needs to update information. Material we share is up to date. Should be
       participatory and members without a gatekeeper functionality by Sarah and Jeremy.

       Sarah wish-list:
       a. Freeze banner a top instead of moving around.
       b. Member position of, how to update? With contact information?
       c. Create an administrator's manual. How to navigate or accomplish tasks on the website?
       d. Fix adding of new users functionality. Ann Martin, her password doesn't work. Administrator
          cannot change.
       e. Looking at reports business meeting, report tab. Post current year and have an archive of
          prior years. 

       Molly different looking and stylish appearance, when she posts. Likes that is user friendly,
       look forward to use calendar and checking. Likes basic information, links to other Quaker sites
       useful. How to post committee reports and minutes on website? Work with recording clerks. 

       Browsing about Colorado Springs Quakers? Searching with search engine, get search terms in website
       for higher Quaker Meetings, Friends in Colorado Springs. What is the situation about Friends Church
       compared to Quaker Meetings, Friends Church has dropped Religious Society of Friends, difference
       between the two. More people use internet to find our Meeting, Quaker Finder well-know, well-respected
       location for our meeting. List of sites for Meeting, make sure we are cross listed.

       First page needs to say what we are, simple explanition of who we are and what we stand for? Something
       from welcome packet, more buttons, about us the first, donation first item. News of the meeting. 
       What is on first page? What is central on front page? Meeting home picture on the first, news. Like buttons,
       add contacts, people tab with committee clerks and business information. Functionality for committee,
       FGC and IMYM memberships. 

       IMYM website, documents, contact people side links. Colorado Springs Friends Meeting is recent origin,
       but Religious Society of Friends goes back to the beginning of our founder. 

       Compress site, more information and side-bars for more information and live links. About us, keep website
       current, get people to do update. Glad to work corporally, impression that website is old. Molly quit updating
       content. Joyce searching organizational websites frustrating to see old content and not up-to-date. Upmost
       importance to keep website current, logistical difficulties. Some attention as a meeting, are there some
       things that we want to be stable and b) keep current with contact. See if continue to support and effort
       and improving website.

       Current site is pilot and needs updating.
  
    2. What functionality besides the broken user management do Friends require from the website?
    3. Should the Meeting look at integrating social media (Facebook, Twitter, Google+) into our website?
    4. What additional functionality would Friends like to have in our website?

 ii. IMYM Directory of Adult members and attenders
     If Friends don't want to be included, must OPT-Out to Ginger or Jeremy. We will honor wishes of Friends.
     We will resend and update directory and then send to IMYM.
iii. IMYM 2012 Census
     Sarah would like to turn over census and email to M&O, leave for Bill and Sarah to work out.     
 iv. Dedicate March potluck Daniel's graduation from CC? He is moving back to up state New York after graduation.
