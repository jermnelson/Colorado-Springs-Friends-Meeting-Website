In attendance: `Ginger Morgan`_ (out going clerk), `Martha Lutz`_, 
`Bill Durland`_, and `Peter LeVar`_.

Meeting opened in silence.

With `Ginger`_’s acceptance to serve as Clerk of the Meeting, `M&O`_ 
discussed with new members the customary duties and business that `M&O`_ 
oversees, including contacting individual members and attenders annually
by phone, visiting or calling home bound Friends, Friends with 
illnesses or other life concerns, facilitating clearness processes 
including requests for clearness about membership, and attending to 
concerns affecting the health of the Meeting.

Outstanding business: we are still awaiting a transfer of membership 
certificate for `Jeremy Nelson`_ from `Salt Lake Friends Meeting`_.

New business: Deb Gimpelson has confirmed her interested in transferring 
her membership to `Kapiti Meeting`_ in New Zealand.  `Ginger`_ will 
bring this item for discussion and approval at next meeting for business.

`Ginger`_ agreed to prepare the next State of the Meeting Report for the
Meeting, inviting all Friends from the meeting to contribute information
for the report including: personal endeavors or activities in the 
broader community that Meeting members or attenders have undertaken in 
response to Friends’ `testimonies`_; update membership changes; 
financial contributions of the meeting to outside groups; updates on our
search for a Meeting home; report on vibrant `First Day school`_ program
and attendance; and participation in `Quaker conferences`_, `programs`_ 
or roles beyond the monthly meeting.

We began conversation about the request by the Meeting to draft a 
charge for the committee recommended for Religious Education in Action.  
Further conversation, seasoning and clarification will be necessary 
before a proposal is made to the meeting for business.

M&O members in attendance reached unity that `Bill Durland`_ would 
accept responsibilities as clerk of M&O.

Meeting was closed in silence.

In the Light,
`Ginger Morgan`_
Outgoing Clerk of `M&O`_
