Finance Committee Minutes
=========================
February 7 at 5:15 at The Herman Group offices
----------------------------------------------

Present: `Sarah Callbeck`_ (clerk), `Ann Daugherty`_ (Bookkeeper) and 
`Lisa Lister`_ (Treasurer and Recorder) and `Ginger Morgan`_ (guest).


We were happy to have `Ginger`_ join us, and we began the meeting in 
silence. Previously, the Meeting approved the hire of part-time 
bookkeeping services to handle financial record management for the 
Meeting, as there is no one within the Meeting who is able to take on 
this role.  Before this is done, however, `Sarah`_ believes that now is the
 right time to move our financial bookkeeping from Excel to Quicken 
Books, as Excel for this purpose is no longer the professional standard,
and is quite awkward.  It will also shorten the amount of time a new 
bookkeeper will have to spend each month on our books.  `Sarah`_ is 
willing to do the advance work to get the books set up properly in 
Quicken, but the Meeting needs to approve the purchase of a license to 
this software.

`Ann`_’s work life has been intensely busy and she is no longer able to 
handle bookkeeper duties for the meeting.  We thank her heartily for her
dedicated past work and we continue to appreciate her ongoing work as 
the Meeting’s realtor.  Sarah will handle the preparation of financial 
statements until a bookkeeper is hired.

The Finance Committee usually sends out print letters to alert members 
that `IMYM`_ and CO Regional assessments are due.  Some members include 
these assessments as a part of their monthly pledge and some pay them 
separately.  This year, will send an email out instead of a print letter.

We ended the meeting with silence.

In the Light,
`Lisa`_
Finance Committee Recorder
