Finance Committee Minutes
=========================

June 4-6, 2012 by email Present: [Sarah
Callbeck](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) (Clerk and Bookkeeper), [Ann
Daugherty](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) and [Lisa
Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/) (Treasurer and Recorder).

GENERAL FUND:
-------------

Revised budget notes (see budget in attachment)

-   Under Reserve Allocations, we have added "Savings" and "Other
    Reserves" to budget the amount we need to reserve for the insurance
    payment due next year. This is a transfer from checking to savings
    and not an expense but a movement of funds from one asset to
    another. It does, however, have an impact on cash flow. Once
    reserved we may not use the funds for any other purpose. The new
    account, Insurance, in the expense section, though a book entry only
    to record prepaid insurance consumed, has the effect of registering
    the impact on cash flow in the Net Budgeted Revenue line.

-   There is now a new category for Liability Pay-Down with Mortgage
    (P&I) under it. The entire mortgage payment is in there until we
    receive an amortization schedule. When Mr. Barker provides that,
    [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) will adjust Mortgage (P&I) to
    reflect only principal paid and move the interest paid to Mortgage
    Interest in the expense section.

Other new accounts under Expense are:

> 1.  Maintenance & Repair which will include the cost of any cleaning
>     supplies, estimated at \$100 for the time being. Future experience
>     will help us refine this number.
>
> 2.  Supplies, Hospitality: estimated at \$100 for the rest of the
>     year.
>
> 3.  Utilities is estimated at \$175/month for 7 months plus actual
>     cost for April & May. In our discussion last month,
>     [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) said we should estimate utilities
>     at \$200 per month, but actual cost has made me optimistic.

2012 PLEDGES
------------

### Pledges to building fund

The Finance Committee hopes that those who have made pledges in 2012
designated for the building fund will allow this money to go straight
into the general fund. The general fund will be used to pay for all
things Meeting-related, including the mortgage.

### WE’RE ON TRACK...

[Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) did quick estimates of revenue for both
general fund and building fund actual donations and compared them to
where we theoretically should be at the end of 5 months. We are very
close to budgeted revenue in both funds.

### ...BUT HAVE A PROJECTED SHORTFALL

The bottom line seems to be that we need all pay a bit more per month or
we need to generate some income by renting out the space. Here are
[Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/)'s calculations on our potential
shortage for the rest of this year:

> 1.  No re-allocation means the deficit of \$5,162.80 stands
>
> 2.  With total re-allocation the calculation is: \$5,162.80 –
>     (\$2,143.76 – \$1,146.51) = \$4,165.55 net deficit for year, or
>     \$595.08 per month for June through December. The \$1,146.51 is
>     the BF donations received through April that were all applied to
>     meetinghouse purchase and initial remodel expense, so are not
>     available to apply towards mortgage.
>
### BUILDING FUND:

No changes have been made to this budget, though we have bought a
building. I’ll wait to see what those who have pledged want to do before
adjusting anything.

### MISCELLANEOUS:

[Lisa](/Friends/LisaLister/) spoke with Ricky Barker about his
preferences for receiving the mortgage check each month. He is happy to
continue to receive a check each month (rather than any kind of
electronic transfer).

This month is local disbursements.

Thanks to [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) for her ongoing hard work,
and for providing the correct wording for these minutes!

In the Light,

[Lisa](/Friends/LisaLister/) Finance Committee recorder
