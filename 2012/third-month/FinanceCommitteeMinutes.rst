Finance Committee Minutes
March 15, 2012 at 5:15 at The Herman Group offices


Present: Sarah Callbeck (Clerk and Bookkeeper), Ann Daugherty and Lisa Lister (Treasurer and Recorder).


Ann brought us up-to-date on the status of the Cimarron property, the details of which will be discussed in Business Meeting.   We discussed how to get the check to the title company, since we do not yet have the final figure and closing date is uncertain.  Instead of waiting for a call, and then having to scramble to get it there in time, Sarah will wire over $40,000 early in the week so it is ready and waiting.  After closing, the title company will write us a check for any portion not needed.
We discussed the following question, which should be brought to Business Meeting: When do we need to notify the Pride Center that we will no longer be paying rent?  Although we do not believe that we have any kind of written rental agreement, we feel it would be nice to give them 30 days notice and perhaps pay rent for April, even if we depart in March.  We are under the impression that their budget is tight.
Quickbooks for the Meeting has been ordered by Sarah and has arrived.  She will be setting up the Meeting’s books as she has time.
Email assessment letters will be emailed to members in April.
National Distributions are this month.  Lisa will update the list and bring copies to Business Meeting.
If you are planning to attend IMYM and need travel assistance, please send your request to Lisa Lister as soon as possible.  The registration deadline for IMYM is April 24, but you will need to know before registration how much the Meeting can contribute, so you then ask for additional help from IMYM if needed.  Lisa would appreciate receiving requests by April 1.  Last year we were able to offer $50 per person assistance from the Meeting.  We hope to be able to offer more this year.  Please do not let lack of money impede you from attending if you have a strong desire to attend.


In the Light,
