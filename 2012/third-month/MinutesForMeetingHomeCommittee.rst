Minutes  of the Meeting Home Committee
March 14, 2012
Present:  Ann Daugherty (clerk), Molly Wingate (secretary),  Julie Roten-Valdez, Carlton Gamer, Brian Murphy
The primary business of the meeting was to go over any issues we feel we need to have attended to in the building as a result of the building inspection.  We must let the sellers know of any issues by Monday, March 19.  Once they respond that they will attend to our concerns, then we must proceed to closing or lose our earnest money ($2,000).  
Inspection Report
The inspection showed that the building is in very good, solid shape.  It also showed that there are some things that aren’t what we had hoped. There were a few other things that need attention, but these are the items we would like talk about with the seller.
1. The electrical box is dangerously old and a hazard.
2. A sprinkler head too close to the building must be moved to stop the moisture leak in the basement room.
3. The basement has no heat.  The heater in the wall dividing the two rooms is not safe and not functional.
4. We must install guttering on the east side of the building to protect the foundation.
5. We must have the heaters checked by an HVAC person.  
We recommend that the Meeting ask to lower the purchase price to accommodate the repairs listed above.  We hope to have amounts for the business meeting on Sunday. We do not want the seller to make the repairs because we will want to change/upgrade what is in the building.  For example, we will want to add 220 volt service to the electrical box, possibly remove all the sprinklers to xeriscape, and probably tear down the wall the basement heater is in. See the next item for a discussion of the roof/gutter.
The Roof
The seller’s insurance will replace the roof.  The seller does not want to pay the $1,000 deductible for the replacement and is perfectly happy to have the insurers simply repair the roof without having to pay a deductible.  If we pay the deductible, we get a new roof for $1,000.  The committee recommends that we go for a new roof and pay the $1,000 deductible and add the gutter while we are there.
The Heaters
The basement can be heated for First Day School with portable heaters that members of the meeting have already offered.  The two gravity heaters in the floor of the sanctuary are very old.  We will know more about them when an HVAC contractor takes a look at them.  We know that they do heat the sanctuary space adequately and rather quickly. We also know that they are not efficient and that when we add to the building, we will have to consider heating solutions. A rough estimate of heating costs is $5 a square foot. If we build the larger addition, the building will be 2,000 square feet in area, so an entirely new, forced air, gas heating system could cost as much as $10,000.
Financing
Brian and Ann have drawn up the papers for our lender. We are borrowing from a private, “hard money” lender since we cannot get a bank loan without someone personally guaranteeing the loan.  The committee is very satisfied with this arrangement.  We will finance $57,000 at 8% interest for 20 years with a 5 year balloon payment.  Our monthly mortgage payment will be $476.77 a month and will have to refinance $50,000 in five years.  We believe that we will be able to get financing through Friends General Conference at that time.  We are making sure that we don’t have a penalty for pre-paying the loan.  We recommend that the meeting accept this financing.
Renovations
The Meeting Home Committee is mindful of Quaker testimonies as it considers renovation.  Such mindfulness will help assure that we have a building that will suit us and will be sellable if and when the time comes. 
We are working with Murphy Constructors who contacted The White Company to do drawings and plans for our renovation.  They are a combination engineering/architecture firm that specializes in saving old buildings.  I will bring their plans to Meeting for Business.  The plans show us that we can renovate this church to meet our needs.
We have enough money to do some renovations, but not enough for everything.  We have talked about doing renovations in stages. When we add to the building, we will have to go through the city planning offices for permits and for a variance for how close the addition will be to the lot line. Until then, we will not need a variance. Here are the very rough estimates for renovations.
        Sanctuary remodel: remove auditorium chairs, stage, and baptismal pool. Take out the carpet and refinish the floors, and maybe repair windows. $7,000
        Basement remodel:  tear out the walls, improve lighting, paint and install nicer flooring.  (Eventually we could excavate to put a bathroom down there.)  $2,000  ($5,000 with bathroom)
        Add an ADA ramp:  Add ramp to the north side of the building, probably when building addition.  $2,000 
        Addition with bathrooms and kitchen: $32,000
                                            OR
        Addition with bathrooms, install kitchen in the sanctuary: $21,000
What can we afford?
Our prudent reserve includes $10,000 for remodeling and $2,000 for maintenance; we have $2,500 in Friends Fiduciary for long term maintenance. After we close, we will see exactly how much money we have. If we can sell the auditorium chairs, we may have a little more to work with. 
What is clear, is that we do not have enough money on hand to tear down the existing bathrooms and build an addition to enclose them.  By financing only the purchase price, we can comfortably remodel the sanctuary and basement, buy some chairs, and get the basics for potlucks to be in the sanctuary.  
We will have some opportunities for “sweat equity” as we paint the exterior, work on the drainage around the building, and change the landscaping. 
Question for the Meeting: 
Can the meeting put up with having the bathrooms on the outside of the building for up to 5 years?
If the answer is yes, then we have some more foot work to do to proceed to a closing. In five years, we will do fundraising and perhaps raise enough to build an addition. Also, when we refinance the loan, we can add to the amount to include a construction loan, if needed. 
If the answer is no, then we must walk away from the deal or borrow more money. After our meeting, I asked Brian to calculate our mortgage payments if we added a construction loan of  $32,000 (the cost of the larger addition) to the current loan.  That would increase the loan to $89,000 and monthly payments would be $744.43.


Questions we are seeking the answers to:
What is the crime rate in the neighborhood?
Will we have to get an occupancy permit to start meeting there?
How much would it cost to do the repairs listed under “inspection”?
