Nominating Committee Report
===========================

May 15, 2012
-------------

We have been in conversation with several members of the Meeting to try 
to fill the position of Clerk of the Meeting as `Ginger Morgan`_ and her 
family prepare to move to Wisconsin. After much seasoning and 
deliberation, we determined that `Molly Wingate`_ would be willing to 
finish `Ginger`_’s term, starting July 1,
2012.

If approved, `Molly`_ has asked that the members of the meeting support 
her in this effort in a few ways, as she has taken on responsibilities 
in our Meeting, in Colorado Regional and in IMYM. Of committees,
she asks that clerks please get reports to `Jeremy Nelson`_ in a timely 
fashion (early in the week before business meeting, if possible) so that 
the agenda for meeting for worship for business can be compiled
and everyone can have a chance to review reports in advance. She also 
asks that clerks please create a calendar of their annual responsibilities 
so that your regular business proceeds in good order.

Of members and attenders, she asks that you please contribute to the 
business of our meeting and that you do your best to review in advance 
the materials for meeting for worship for business. Also she asks
that when possible please take to committees whatever business you have 
instead of bringing it directly to our monthly business meeting.

Finally, `Molly`_ would like to be replaced as a member of the 
`Nominating Committee`_.

In the Light,

`Molly Wingate`_ and `Jonathan McPhee`_
