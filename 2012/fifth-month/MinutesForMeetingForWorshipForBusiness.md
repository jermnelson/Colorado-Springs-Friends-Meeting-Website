        substantially

        [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) has agreed to be the contact
        person for all contractor. She is working with the building's
        previous owners insurance company to pay for the roof. The
        previous owner's insurance company is putting some limits but
        [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) and lawyer are working on this
        matter. The roof determined to be priority when we moved in;
        committee needs to figure this out because the roof is in bad

        [Jennifer](/Friends/JenniferRoberts/) is interested in internal
        decorating and acoustics and joining the committee.

        [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) suggested to help address the
        acoustic issues by shrinking the size of the circle to a double
        circle and adding another rug. An email be send out about
        Friends Acoustics are an urgent priority, look at temporary
        measures until a permanent solution is found.

        [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) noted that visitors may be put out
        by the meeting house that the sounds and acoustics problems.

    e.  First Day School Committee [EMAIL GINGER about her email to
        John] Need to be reorganized to plan [First
        Day](/committees/FirstDay/) school. Schedule does not seem to
        functioning, we will ask John Gallenger to take the lead to
        coordinate sessions and contact schedules. This summer may be
        different from regular session during the year.

        Young friends will be in charge of decorating the room for First
        day school in the basement.

    f.  Adult Religious Education and Social Action Committee Finishing

        education session.

        Ginger will be doing a session on membership for attenders in
        early June.

        Genie is unclear where Friends can meet for the education
        committee. For the time being, the main room's acoustics will
        make it hard to run a class for now meet in YF basement room.

    g.  Library Library is here in three parts; non-children stuff, all
        of the kids material is in the basement YF room. The filing
        cabinet in the hallway with a new bookcases for collection.

        service and roll into Meeting for Worship at 10:00 with the
        party afterwards.

        [Genie](/Friends/GenieDurland/) asked if we should a dedicated
        time during Meeting for Worship for late friends to come into
        the meeting. For next week, request Friends to wait until
        memorial service is finished, before coming into the Meeting for
        Worship.

        [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) wondered about expectations of
        DeeDee's family for memorial services and should be an hour and
        start at 9:00? Is Memorial service a formal Memorial Meeting?
        Yes. [Martha](/Friends/MarthaLutz/) will be consulting with
        DeeDee family about their desires.

        Balance between openness and hospitality but still encourage
        Friends to arrive on time. Need balance between the two and M&O
        will take this matter for consideration.

        Coordinate with DeeDee's family about options of first having
        Meeting for Worship. Maybe if we could have a different day of
        the week for DeeDee's memorial? [Martha](/Friends/MarthaLutz/)
        will be following up with DeeDee's family about their wishes.
        Maybe Saturday or Monday? [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) will
        ask the family.

    c.  June's Business Meeting is scheduled when people are coming back
        from IMYM. Should be 10th or 17th?
        [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) won't be here on the 17th,
        [Ginger](/Friends/GingerMorgan/) recommends that Meeting for
        Business on the 10th. Friends are encouraged to send committee
        reports by Monday or Tuesday.

    d.  [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) asks if we should have our own
        phone number, wired or not, for the building?
        [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) asked if the new addition will
        have an office? Plans are still up and designs can modified.
        Meeting House committee will undertake this matter.

        [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) added that Quaker Meeting
        traditionally open to other groups including neighbors, to use
        the space. [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) asked if we should
        have an open house for this neighborhood? Yes, and another
        matter for the Meeting House committee for consideration.
