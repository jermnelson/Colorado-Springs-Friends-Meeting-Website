First Day, January 29th, 2012
-----------------------------

In attendance: `Molly Wingate`_, `Ginger Morgan`_, `Joyce Doyle`_, `Sarah Callback`_, `Bill Durland`_, `Genie Durland`_, 
`John Gallagher`_, `Maria Melendez`_, `Peter LeVar`_, `Jeremy Nelson`_, Jack Semple


During announcements at the closing of Meeting for Worship, `Molly Wingate`_, as chair of the Meeting Home 
Committee, passed around a real estate listing about a property and church located at **950 E. Cimarron** that 
recently came upon the market. The older Congregational Church is in good physical condition with bolted 
stadium seating that could seat up to a 100 people with two small rooms in the basement that could be combined
into a single room for first day school. The bathrooms are located on the outside of the church, there is no 
kitchen and little parking space. Molly cautioned that this is an older building that if we remodelled we may 
have to bring the electrical and plumbing up to the current building codes with much greater costs.

The church is still being used by a dwindling congregation who wish to sell at a price of $95,000. Due to 
the low cost and time sensitivity involved with this property, `Molly`_ requested from the Meeting  a conditional
contract be put together by attorneys associated with the Meeting such that negotiations can begin with 
the current owners. `Ginger`_ brought the matter before the assembled members and attenders as a special Minute. 
The consensus was that the Meeting should go forward with this conditional contract with the understanding 
that the Meeting could withdraw at any time and that more discussion would follow at the next `Business Meeting`_ 
for Worship and may require another called Meeting as well. 


Respectfully submitted in the light,
`Jeremy Nelson`_
