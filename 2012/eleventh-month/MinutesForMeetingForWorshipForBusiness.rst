========================================
Meeting for Worship for Business Minutes
========================================
:Date: $Date: 2012-11-18 11:24:00 +0000 (Sun, 18 November 2012) $

Present: `Carlton Gamer`_, `Genie Durland`_, `Bill Durland`_, `Sarah Callbeck`_, 
`Ann Daugherty`_, `Molly Wingate`_ (clerk), and `Lisa Lister`_ (Acting Recording Clerk).

1. The Clerk read queries from Fort Collins Friends Newsletter, Oct., 2012.  The 
   following queries were read (from IMYM Faith and Practice, pages 117-119), which 
   prompted Bill to propose that M&O further explore vocal ministry, and perhaps 
   facilitate a discussion with the wider Meeting:

   * When in meeting for worship, do I clear my mind so that the Spirit has a place 
     to enter?
   * Do I wait in great expectancy for the Spirit to speak – through me or through 
     another?
   * Do I put my trust in the still small voice that I may hear?
   * How do I discern the source of a leading?
   * How do I know when to speak?
   * Do I hold myself back when moved to speak, or do I trust in the Light to lead me?
   * Am I careful not to speak at undue length or beyond my light?
   * Am I aware of a sense of "rightness" after I speak?
   * Does attendance at meeting for worship strengthen my spirit for the week ahead?
   * What brings me back to center – back to inner wisdom, home to myself – and how can 
     I make that a regular practice?

   The October Minutes were accepted.

2. The Cash Flow Reports, which were presented by Sarah (attached).

3. Clerk’s Report.  We will hold our first Show and Tell on Friday, November 23 
   from 5-7 PM at the meeting house. Please bring a dish to share – perhaps some 
   Thanksgiving leftovers.  `Carlton`_ will begin showing and telling. 


4. COMMITTEE REPORTS

   a. Finance Committee report is attached.  `Sarah`_ has been setting up our 
      finances in QuickBooks.  This has been taking some time and tweaking.  
      Brian is setting up our tax-exempt status.  `Sarah`_ reviewed the draft budget 
      for 2013—the final budget will be presented at the December business meeting.  
      We also looked at the new Balance Sheet and a Revenue Statement output from 
      QuickBooks to make sure we were comfortable with these new report layouts 
      and content.   We are all thankful for `Sarah`_ 's hard work, and the Finance 
      Committee report was accepted with deep gratitude.

   b. Nominating Committee report was given by `Genie`_.  `Bill Werling`_ and 
      `Genie Durland`_ are on the Nominating Committee.  They may be contacting 
      people about their willingness to serve.  

      ACTION: We approved Ann Martin as a member of M&O. 


   c. Ministry and Oversight report was given by `Bill`_ and accepted with thanks. They 
      discussed the greeting of visitors and how to be of support to `Jonathan McPhee`_.  
  
      The full report is attached.  

   d. First Day School Committee.  There is no written report, but the First Day School 
      children will be painting a mural downstairs during our next work day, November 25.  
      `Molly`_ will be the adult presence.

   e. Adult Education and Action Committee (Two items)

      1. ITEM 1: Molly read a minute on divestment which was drafted by Genie, 
         and is before us for consideration:

         "We, Colorado Springs Friends Meeting, Religious Society of Friends, 
         embrace the spirit and support the goals of the We Divest Campaign of 
         the American Friends Service Committee.

         We understand that this campaign was launched in partnership with 
         Jewish Voice for Peace and that it demands that TIAA-CREF stop investing 
         in corporations that enable the destruction of Palestinian homes and 
         orchards, the expansion of Israeli settlements and infrastructure, 
         checkpoint surveillance of Palestinian communities, and provide weapons 
         used against civilians. The campaign does not ask people to directly 
         divest from TIAA-CREF. Rather it organizes retirement fund recipients to 
         exercise their rights as shareholders and witness to TIAA-CREF (a company 
         with $441 billion in assets) to divest from corporations that profit 
         from the military occupation.

         As Friends who value our testimonies of Peace, Equality, Community, 
         Integrity and Simplicity and strive to live by them, we unite with the 
         AFSC campaign. We see the campaign as an example of speaking truth to 
         power – in this case to the power of unjust profit – both as 
         individuals and as a Meeting. We recognize that peace in the Middle 
         East is dependent upon true justice for Palestinians and so seek to support 
         all nonviolent efforts to further that cause."

         ACTION: This minute was approved by the Meeting.  Genie will let AFSC and 
         IMYM know that we have approved this minute.

      2. ITEM 2: Coloradans Against the Death Penalty support: 
         Molly read the "Resolution of Support and Organizational Membership" 
         sent to us from the Coloradans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty:

         "WHEREAS, the death penalty diverts millions of dollars a year of state 
         resources into an arbitrary, unreliable, wasteful and unnecessary 
         capital punishment system, and

         WHEREAS, the death penalty does not deter crime; and

         WHEREAS, the death penalty is imposed in an arbitrary and discriminatory 
         manner;

         WHEREAS, there are a growing number of known cases of wrongful conviction 
         and increasing evidence that there have been wrongful executions; and

         WHEREAS, the death penalty prolongs pain for victims' families, dragging 
         them through an agonizing and lengthy process that holds out the promise 
         of an execution at the beginning but often results in a different 
         sentence in the end; and

         WHEREAS, our communities require the best protection and convicted 
         murderers must be severely punished; and

         WHEREAS, in the state of Colorado, there are two possible sentences 
         for Capital Murder; life without the possibility of parole and death. 
         We agree that death should not be an option and, therefore, the 
         sentence would be life without the possibility of parole.

         THEREFORE, we join the Coloradoans for Alternatives to the Death 
         Penalty and others in publicly supporting legislation that abolishes 
         the death penalty in our state. We recognize that the sole mission of 
         the Coalition is to repeal the death penalty in Colorado. We 
         understand that our organization will be listed as a member of the 
         Coalition and agree to inform our members of our participation and invite 
         them to be active in the campaign as part of our efforts and/or those of 
         the Coalition or another member organization. We acknowledge our right to 
         participate, or to not participate, in the meetings and decisions of 
         the Coalition. We recognize that any resource implications involved 
         in joining the Coalition are entirely voluntary."

         ACTION: We approved signing the resolution letter.  We suggested that 
         M&O look at this issue and explore further if they believe the Meeting 
         should write its own minute.


  f. The Meeting Home Committee.  The full report is attached and was accepted.
     There will be a work day on November 25th at the rise of meeting.  We need to 
     clean bathrooms, dust, vacuum/sweep and mop floors.  The children will be 
     working on painting a mural in the basement.


  g. The Library Report was given verbally by Joyce and accepted with thanks. 
     Her full report, including an inventory will be submitted to the next business meeting.

OLD BUSINESS
Signs for religious education and bathrooms.  Lisa volunteered for this last month, but has not accomplished it yet.  She will do this soon, even if they are temporary signs.

b. Do we need a “steward” of the building?  
ACTION: Nominating Committee will talk to Peter about the role of this person, and the committee will draw up a list of responsibilities of this person. 
NEW BUSINESS
a) Colorado Springs will be the host of the spring gathering of Colorado Regional Meeting April 28th, 2013, so we will need to think about making some preparations.

b) A Quaker family from Durango Monthly Meeting will be here on Sunday, December 9 to worship with us. Their daughter, age 19, is functionally deaf and they are planning for her to matriculate for one semester at the State School here in Colorado Springs. They are hopeful of finding local Quakers to provide support for their daughter and have asked if there is a family or individual in our meeting who would consider hosting her for one or two weekends a month between January and May.
ACTION: Bill Wherling’s family has volunteered to host this student.  We all think this is wonderful.
