checkout system with the use of a checkout log book for easy recording
of the borrower’s name, book title, phone number, check out and in
dates. Previously, we had no way of determining how much the library was
being used. With the log book we can report 9 books were checked out in
2011 and 7 in 2012. While these numbers are small, they are three to
four times as in 2010. Now, in our new meeting home with room to spread
out our growing collection and to browse, our library is easily
accessible. 3. Organization With the donation of a bookcase with widely
spaced shelves, we now have an area to keep many oversized materials
that were previously in storage or in the file cabinet (see the
Inventory listing: Oversized Materals). Magazine holders allow us to
have a year or more of Friends Journal, Western Friend and newsletters
close at hand for easy reference or browsing. The file 3 cabinet holds
the older copies and other materials as noted in the inventory under
Periodicals and Newsletters. The Non-Violence sections--Conscientious
Objection, War-tax Resistance and Conflict Resolution--are now
subsections under the heading Peace & Justice Concerns. Many titles in
the Christianity & Miscellaneous section are moved to the Peace &
Justice Concerns section under the subsection: General. The Christianity
& Miscellaneous section is further divided into four sections:
Christianity, World Religions, World History, Miscellaneous. 4.
Inventory The library will maintain the Inventory List on Google Doc and
print hard copies as needed. Hard copies are located in Library
Inventory (narrow white) binder in Oversized Materials, with the
checkout log, and in folder with Children/Youth’s Curriculum. It seems
appropriate and useful to make the Inventory available on our website
and propose that this be done when possible. The Card Catalog will not
be continued, but retained in the file cabinet (that is, not discarded).
The previous two inventories, 2009 and 2010, were followed by a list of
items “not checked out but missing” from the collection, however the
items were left in the inventory list without note they were missing.
The 2012 Inventory List, instead, indicates the missing items with an
asterisk, without the following list of missing items. Such a list can
be assembled if it becomes necessary. 5. Checked out items The following
items have been checked out but not returned. If you are finished with
them, please return: Title Checked out by & Date Jane Addams & Hull
House Carolyn Kuban 11/20/11 Quaker Profiles & Practices Katherine
Fatica 5/6/12 6. Recommendations 1. As mentioned above, include
inventory on our website. 2. Acquire, through donation or purchase,
titles by our members/attenders which pertain to Quaker values/concerns.

Respectfully submitted, Joyce Doyle
