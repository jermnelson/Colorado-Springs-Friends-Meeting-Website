Finance Committee Minutes
=========================

12-11-2012

Present: [Sarah Callbeck](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) (clerk), [Ann
Daugherty](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/), and [Lisa
Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/) (treasurer and recording clerk).

We met at Lisa's house.

Before Sarah arrived, Ann and Lisa discussed the idea of Sarah becoming
bookkeeper for the meeting. The job pays \$60 a month and is budgeted.
We believe that Sarah would be the perfect person for this position
because of her intimate knowledge of our finances. She has already spent
many years and countless hours setting up our books, preparing budgets,
and faithfully stewarding the Meeting's resources. We recommend that the
Meeting approve Sarah for this position.

This month we have \$100 for local distributions. An updated list is
attached.

The treasurer will pay FGC \$100, which is our annual donation.

We reviewed the draft budget for 2013, and thank Sarah profusely for her
dedication and hard work in preparing it. The bottom line (projected
revenue minus projected expenses) reveals a modest shortfall, and
although concerning, we feel it is not serious. Hope springs eternal! We
seek approval from the Meeting for the 2013 budget.

We reviewed the cash flow report.

We discussed what funds are available to purchase a new furnace, AC,
fans and insulation, as the Meetinghouse Committee is considering how to
proceed. Ann will convey this information back to the Meetinghouse
Committee, so they can make a recommendation to the Meeting.

We discussed the concept of keeping a certain amount of cash available
in permanent reserve as a financial safety net. We are striving toward
accruing a six month permanent reserve for mortgage and utilities. We
are trying to maintain a \$2,000 checking account balance at all times,
but this is not always possible.

The Committee wishes to remind members and attenders that an end-of-year
donation to the Meeting would be welcome!

In the Light,

[Lisa Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/)
