Meeting House Committee Report
==============================

December 14, 2012

Emeeting with input from Ann Daugherty\_ (clerk), [Molly
Wingate](/Friends/MollyWingate/), [Daniel
Kidney](/Friends/DanielKidney/), and from finance committee members
[Sarah Callbeck](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) and [Lisa
Lister](/Friends/LisaLister/).

We have a big decision to make on Sunday, if we can come to unity. The
Meeting House Committee offers two possibilities for replacing our
heater so that we have adequate heater upstairs and downstairs.

Meeting House and Finance Committees have been collecting bids and
working over our finances and here are the proposals. With both of these
proposals, the Finance Committee would have a prudent reserve, but not
if we spend more than option \#1.

1.  92% efficient heater with A/C and all duct work for \$11,512.61

2.  92% heater and all duct work with ceiling fans and insulation in the
    attic: 8453.90 + \$770 (LIGHTS AND FANS) + \$1350 (insulation in
    attic) = \$10,573

We have the opportunity to take advantage of 2012 prices if we can come
to unity. Also we will have the opportunity to have a discount on the
A/C if we do the heater and A/C at the same time.

A few commented that ceiling fans and insulation are prudent and
eco-friendly projects to make the most of our new heater and might do
enough to cool the worship space.

A few mentioned that we are more likely to be able to rent the meeting
house to others if we have A/C.

We were reminded that the Friends General Conference Meeting House Fund
encouraged us to ask for money again, so if we find we need A/C, we have
a potential funding source. We could also ask for money for fans,
rewiring the lights, and insulation.
