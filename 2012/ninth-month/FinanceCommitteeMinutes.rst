Finance Committee Minutes
=========================
:Date: $Date: 2012-09-12 17:30:48 +0000 (Wed, 12 Sept 2012) $

Present: `Sarah Callbeck`_ (clerk), `Ann Daugherty`_, and `Lisa Lister`_ 
(Treasurer and Recording clerk).

**The Cash Flow report**

Was reviewed, and thanked Sarah for her work.

**Colorado Regional Fall gathering **

Registration deadline is Sept. 19.  If anyone wishes to make a request for 
travel assistance, please do so by this coming First Day, 9-16.

**National distributions**

The September Business Meeting is the time when we consider donating to 
national organizations.   Attached is the list of latest donations.  There are
several special requests to keep in mind as we make our decisions:

AFSC has a contribution match campaign.  If they can raise $800,000 by 
September 30, they will receive a match of $1,700,000.

**Friends Fiduciary funds**

Our funds continue to slowly recover their worth since the 2008 financial recession.

**Future expenses**

We are still waiting on a final quote from Fountain Valley Electric for the 
removal of the unsafe gas heater between the two bathrooms, but have received 
a quote of $1,170 for installing baseboard heaters in the bathrooms and outlets
in the basement.  We also received a quote from David Vanderweit for this work.  

However, the Finance Committee decided not to hire him because he did not think
it was important to pull permits.  Because of potential long-term liability 
issues that could arise by circumventing the permit process, we did not feel 
comfortable with using David for this job. Ann learned that the gas heaters do 
not need to be removed before Fountain Valley can do their work, so they have 
been given the go-ahead to proceed.

**Property Valuation Notice**

We received a Property Valuation notice from the El Paso County Assessor.  It 
states a tax value, but in another section says we are exempt.  Since this is 
the first year we have received this notice (and it is a tad confusing), we 
want to make sure they know we are a religious group.  Ann will stop by the 
Assessor office just to make certain all is well.

**501(c)3 status**

We have not filed for this status, which would exempt us from paying sales tax.  
Because we have been purchasing more items for the new Meeting House, it has 
come up as a question about whether it would be worth filing for this status.  
The cost to file is very expensive, and the preparation of the paperwork 
onerous.  Right now, we do not believe that it would be worth the time and 
expense.


What money do we have left for Meeting House purchases?

Based on the table above, it is clear that we have little money left to spend
on Meeting House expenses unless more funds are generated.

In the Light,
