Meeting House Committee Report
==============================
September 2012

Emeeting: `Molly Wingate`_, `Ann Daughtery`_, `Daniel Kidney`_

1. We will have the electricians out in the next few days to install heaters in
   the bathrooms and storage area and install electrical outlets in the basement.
   
2. Daniel Kidney put up the white boards in the basement.

3. Lisa Lister has arranged for a 25 X 15 foot carpet to be installed in the 
   meeting room. She has donated the binding of the carpet. We believe that 
   this carpeting will have a good effect on our acoustics.
   
4. We have prepared the windowsills (exterior) for painting.

5. Lisa is lettering our sign!

6. Finance Committee has made it clear that we have spent all the money we can on the
   meeting house until we raise some more.
   
7. We request that those Friends who have mentioned donating space heaters consider
   dropping them off soon.

8. Work Day September 23rd:
   
   *. Paint the window sills
   *. Housekeeping
   *. Yard tidying
   *. Install the new security mailbox to the inside of the front door (so we can quit
      paying for a P. O. Box)
   *. Remove paint that came off of the ceiling from the heater and fire it up
