chapter 4.

1.  Approval of August Minutes for Meeting for Business.
    [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) volunteered to take the material and
    change the address. What about publications like Western Friends, do
    we want to forward mail to the Meeting house from the P.O. box to
    the Meeting House. [Lisa](/Friends/LisaLister/) volunteered to
    change the address at the post office. Could
    [Lisa](/Friends/LisaLister/) pick up a packet of change-of-address
    with postcards to send to publishers and newsletters from other
    Meetings.

2.  Cash Flow Report: previously emailed. We finally paid assessments
    for Colorado Regional Meeting. Ending balance checking end of Aug
    \$3297.25, down a bit from the prior month
    [Sarah](/Friends/SarahCallbeck/) we are still holding steady. No
    change in emergency or other reserves. No change in building funds.
    In Finance Committee meeting report has much more details. All
    total, we paid \$1752.48 for the roof instead of \$2,000. Calvert
    balance down some, total 14,322.00 in building
    [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) joy that Cash flow report accepted.

3.  Committee Reports:

> a.  Finance Committee: previously emailed Colorado Regional Fall
>     gathering meeting, please let committee know now. This month is
>     the national distribution will find a suggestions for national
>     distributions. AFSC has a contribution matching campaign as we
>     decide the national distribution. At Friend's Fiduciary funds they
>     are slowly recovering from recession of a few years ago.
>
>     We received a Property Valuation notice from the El Paso County
>     Assessor. It states a tax value, but in another section says we
>     are exempt. Since this is the first year we have received this
>     notice (and it is a tad confusing), we want to make sure they know
>     we are a religious group. Ann will stop by the Assessor office
>     just to make certain all is well.
>
>     **501(c)3 status** We have not filed for this status, which would
>     exempt us from paying sales tax. Because we have been purchasing
>     more items for the new Meeting House, it has come up as a question
>     about whether it would be worth filing for this status. The cost
>     to file is very expensive, and the preparation of the paperwork
>     onerous. Right now, we do not believe that it would be worth the
>     time and expense. [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) supports the
>     Finance Committee recommendations. Do any other Meetings have this
>     status? Came up with a email from Mountain View. People in the
>     Yearly meeting are talking about.

>     1.  National Distribution, [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/)'s thought
>         that if you have a matching funds grant FCNL have such a small
>         staff, [Bill](/Friends/BillDurland/) suggested that we give
>         \$50 to AFSC and to FCNL. Friends are in unity with this

>     greeters for Meeting. M&O hasn't come up with any recommendations
>     as they are still considering and reflecting as the right course
>     opens up for the Meeting. It is up to all of us to be friendly to
>     a new person after meeting and that Friends need to just be aware
>     and assist with any new
>
>     Mission statement changed to M&O guidelines. People need to be
>     sensitive to the need of the meetings for quiet for Meeting for
>     Worship on first days. Friends are encouraged to try to arrive by
>     the start but M&O sensitive to the different circumstances that
>     Friends may not be able to arrive on time but M&O looking at ways
>     for late arriving Friends to join Meeting for Worship that is to

4.  Old business

>     [Julie](/Friends/JulieRoten-Valdez/).
>     [Ann](/Friends/AnnDaugherty/) asked if we should we send a large

5.  New Business

    1.  [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/) suggested that we have an
        event "show-and-tell" where we all come to learn about what
        Friends in the Meeting are involved with including creative and
        professional interests. [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/)
        suggested that we have the event in the week for a couple of
        hours. To start for those Friends that are doing stuff and who
        want to share with the rest of the Meeting have them state what
        they are working and if there are interest in others. This would
        be an ad hoc and Wednesday sounds okay. This wouldn't have to be
        monthly deal.

        Send out an email to the whole meeting stating the idea and ask
        for 1. Who would be interested in attending the event? Who would
        be interested in sharing something?
        [Carlton](/Friends/CarltonGamer/)'s show and tell. Input from
        the wider meeting along with a SurveyMonkey about answering
        these questions. What weeknight would work for everyone and
        happen in the next two months. Recording clerk will create a
        survey and send out

    2.  Trustees of the Meetings. [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/)
        interested in finding out about what trustees do at other
        Meetings and they keep their eyes on the larger picture.
        [Molly](/Friends/MollyWingate/) is pursing and finding out what
        trustees.

6.  Announcements

    1.  Colorado Regional Meeting will be in Estes Park (October 19-21)

        community as Quakers. Registration at <imym.org>. Several
