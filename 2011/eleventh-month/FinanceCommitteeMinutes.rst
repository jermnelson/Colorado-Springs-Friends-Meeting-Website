Finance Committee Minutes
=========================
November 8, 2011 at The Herman Group offices
--------------------------------------------

Present: `Sarah Callbeck`_ (clerk), `Ann Daugherty`_ (Bookkeeper) and  
`Lisa Lister`_ (Treasurer and Recorder).

We opened with silence.

Our Friends Journal subscription is due soon.  We normally subscribe for a 
two-year period, but their pricing has changed.  Because of financial 
struggles, they have a new tiered payment model, which, for a one-year 
subscription is “True cost” ($150), “Traditional” ($45) and 
“Modest Income” ($25).  We have $78 budgeted in this budget year to 
pay for a 2-year subscription.  What does the Meeting wish to do?  

We need to know in order to subscribe now, and also for future budgeting purposes.
Although we discussed the idea of moving Business Meeting from the second Sunday of the month to the third Sunday during the last Business Meeting, we would like to re-introduce this idea again.  Because of the Ann’s work schedule, it difficult for her to prepare the cash flow by the second Sunday of the month.  This is a labor of love on the part of our bookkeeper, and is an essential service to the meeting.  We will ask the Meeting to consider this possibility.
Sarah has reached clarity that she can no longer continue to help with the more complex bookkeeping duties.  Ann will continue preparing the cash flow report (for which she was praised), but quarterly financial reports need the attention of a financial professional.  Sarah will continue as serve as Finance Committee clerk.  A line item has been added to the 2012 budget in order to contract for accounting services.  If anyone has suggestions of someone who might be interested, please pass his or her name and contact information to a member of the Finance Committee.  This person would need to be either an accountant or full-charge bookkeeper.
We reviewed the amount of the pledges received thus far and the tentative 2012 draft budget in preparation for Business Meeting.  In addition, Ann and Sarah reviewed this month’s cash flow report.

We closed in blissful silence.

In the Light,

`Lisa`_
