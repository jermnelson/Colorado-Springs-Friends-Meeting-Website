=======================================================================================

Queries offered in advance were prepared by `Ginger Morgan`_:

Integrity
---------
Friends do not want to deceive or exploit anyone.  Therefore, we arrive at what
we consider a fair value for buying and selling time, labor, material goods and 
services.  We do not try to gather any profit in excess of need or worth. Friends 
attempt to behave with honesty in all our relationships.  In speaking truth to 
others, we speak the truth in love..

Query: 
^^^^^^
In considering this decision, have we spoken truthfully to ourselves and one another?

Query:
^^^^^^
How do we identify a property reflective of our real needs?

Simplicity
----------
A simple life is often hard to achieve.  It means consuming or collecting 
nothing in excess of what is needful for our health and well-being and 
understanding what that is.

Query: 
^^^^^^
Do we understand what our meeting needs for its well-being? 

`Simplicity`_ is expressed in our stewardship of our material resources.  It 
implies consuming not more than we need and can afford, not spending beyond 
our means, providing what we require for our well-being in every sense..

Query: 
^^^^^^
What can we afford? How will we determine if we are spending beyond our means? 

Peace
-----
Because we do not think of peace as merely the absence of war, we try in peacetime
to remain aware of the great disparities in well-being and livelihood all over the 
world, these being the primary cause of violence among nations.

Query:
^^^^^^ 
How will the purchase of this property allow us to or inhibit us from addressing
the conditions and occasions that foster the seeds of violence? 

The peace testimony of the `Religious Society of Friends`_ is a positive 
expression of goodwill in human relationships, not just a negative statement 
calling us to abstain from all that leads to war..

Query:
^^^^^^
How might purchasing property equip us to foster conditions where cooperation, 
equality, justice and freedom can flourish?

Equality
--------
Since the time of `George Fox`_, Friends have believed that all people are 
spiritually equal before God..

Jesus stressed the unique nature and worth of each individual.  It is 
unreasonable to expect assimilation or to ignore difference, claiming to treat 
everyone the same.  This denies the value of variety, which presents not a 
problem, but a creative challenge to live adventurously..

Query: 
^^^^^^
What meeting location might assist us or hinder us in connecting with a wider variety of people?  

Community
---------
It is not possible to be a human being without being part of a community.  
Community is shelter, a safe place to grow, an arena for action, caring 
and love, powered by and united in the Light.

Query: 
^^^^^^
How do we find a property that can provide us shelter, a place to grow and 
an arena for action, caring and love?

Query: 
^^^^^^
What do we need from a property in order to serve the needs of our children and 
youth?

Friends find the center of their life together in the meeting for worship.  
Although Friends worship any time the Spirit moves them to, they set aside 
specific times and places to gather for worship as a community.

Query: 
^^^^^^
What kind of place do we envision where we can worship together? 


In attendance:
--------------
`Bill Werling`_, `Joyce Doyle`_, `Bill Durland`_, `Genie Durland`_, `Carlton Gamer`_, 
`Julie Roten-Valdez`_, `Jeremy Nelson`_, `Ginger Morgan`_, `Martha Lutz`_, `Molly Wingate`_, 
`Ann Daugherty`_, `Sarah Callbeck`_, `Peter LeVar`_

`Ginger`_ suggested that our conversation have three parts:  
    Do we want a meeting house?  
    What do we want?  
    What process will be used?
She further suggested that we use the format of a worship sharing to start.  We settled into silence.

`Ginger`_ read this query first:
    A simple life is often hard to achieve.  It means consuming or collecting 
    nothing in excess of what is needful for our health and well-being and 
    understanding what that is..  

Query:
^^^^^^
Do we understand what our meeting needs for its well-being? 

`Ann Daughtery`_ offered that this is the most important question. She used an 
example to show that if you don't grow, you will die.  The secret is to 
control the growth.  
    Do we want more members?  She thinks youth is important.  
    Do we need a facility to do that? 

`Molly Wingate`_ talked about the meaning of the phrase well being.  For her,
well being for the meeting means being able to reach out more effectively to the 
`community`_ with a building to share our values and `testimonies`_.

`Bill`_ related the experience of the Justice and Peace Commission.  The place 
is one of several instruments that illuminate the activity of the group.  The 
group has to have an activity.  The place is a necessary spoke for the other 
activity to happen.  Some at the J&P said, 
    We can just meet on the street.  Street witness is enough. 
The J&P had a huge threshing session.  The consensus was that they need a place.  
It wasn't a happy experience, but it was certainly a growing one.  And eventually 
everything worked out.

`Carlton`_ asked us to look to the word *need*.  
   Do we need a meetinghouse?  We have gone on for 50 years without one, and we 
   can continue indefinitely this way.  

   Is that path the ideal?  No.  We are not driven to find a meeting house, but 
   it is the ideal.

`Genie`_ added that `Carlton`_ spoke her mind.  She added finding a meetinghouse 
means it continues to be a goal of the meeting as a whole.  The more important 
question for `Genie`_ is, 
   Are we ready?  And she is not clear about that.  

If there are others who are not clear that the time is right, then we need to 
thresh that question of readiness. She is not ready.

`Julie`_ said that the clearer we are at this end, the sooner it will happen. 
`Simplicity`_ makes her think about the actual building **it being simple**. 
Something we find, or something that we build.  As a worship `community`_, we 
need to do more than individually live good lives; we need to offer to the 
`community`_ the opportunity to live these good lives, too.  We need a place 
to offer to the people that they can recognize. She  wants finding us simpler, 
and she wants the building to be simple.  Her first meeting house spoke of that 
`simplicity`_ in the building and the furnishings, and then she was welcomed.  
She knew of the building for years before it came clear that she needed to find 
another fellowship.  She knew where it was because she had seen it.

`Martha Lutz`_ felt that `Julie`_ spoke her mind until she talked about her 
experience with her first meeting. She spoke of the worship space at Burlington 
VT.  There is something about walking into a simple space that allows God 
presence more obvious.  I think we can have that kind of space.

`Joyce Doyle`_ 
  home is where the heart is.  
And then she shared that her experience is that when the container overwhelms 
the contents with preoccupations, it is not good.  She left two churches 
because of the focus of the churches became money not spirituality.  It was 
soul killing.  Her experience is that the `Quaker testimonies`_ were not part of 
the discussion.  When we looked at `15 S Wahsatch`_, she was relieved by our 
financial cushion. She still has concerns about how we will deal with 
financial issues down the road using the `testimonies`_.  

`Ginger`_ read an email from `Barbara Will`_.  The building is not really 
important.  We can do the `community`_ activities without a building.  She sees 
that some are pushing for a building, some are against it.  But we have a very 
low participation. She has a sense of reservation as an observer; having a 
building alone will not change the dynamics of the meeting.

`Ann Martin`_ observes
   How can we have a meeting house when just getting someone to open is a challenge?
We need to unite around a meetinghouse as a community..

`Peter LeVar`_ shared that one of the last comments her heard from Linda was it 
would be better if it is just looked like a meeting house, and he concurs.  The
`15 S Wahsatch`_ appealed because little had to be removed.  Maybe we should just 
buy a piece of land and build our own building. We don.t have a meeting house 
because we haven't found the right place.  Also, our funds would barely cover the 
purchase.

`Julie`_ added that the building be accessible and on one level.  We can start 
with one room and expand, paying as we go.

`Molly`_ reminded the group that `Tup Roberts`_ drew us some conceptual plans 
that would be big enough to start, but would require that we finish it all.  
*WE* could use his plan to build and expandable meetinghouse.

`Ann Daugherty`_ reminded us that we would need a .47 acre unimproved lot and 
in our parameters for location made that has not been possible. We have a 
professional estimate that the building plan Tup created would cost roughly 
$300,000.  She noted that some parcels of land are becoming available, but 
they are very far east of the area we have looked at.

`Ginger`_ asked for any views about the needs for a meeting house that 
haven't been voiced yet.

`Genie`_ added that she has had experience across the country.  She can think 
of at least 5 meetings in `IMYM`_ and several in the East who have experienced 
excruciating trauma in the process of building or improving a meeting house.  
The issues were about how much money you devote to buildings when there is so 
much need in the world.  And then there were questions of taste.  She fears that 
for us.  She doesn't see any need for us to put ourselves in that position.  What 
other kinds of growth do we need to do to be ready to grow that does not need a 
meetinghouse.

`Martha`_ asked if we have had a good space.

`Carlton`_ said there have always been problems.  We have never had a good space.  
He recounted his experience with the challenges for Mountainview when they 
acquired a meetinghouse.  

`Ann Daughtery`_ pointed out that this building, the Women's Club, feels very good.   
She mentioned too that the GoodFellows Hall on South Union would allow us, but it 
is very large and cold.

`Carlton`_ commented that it seems to him that since we have been mulling it 
for a long time, if we found a really good space, we would find ourselves 
ready.  If we are spiritually ready and the space becomes available that we 
would probably find that we are ready.  We have been gradually preparing 
ourselves for a long time.

`Bill`_ added that he has been thinking about **the way opening**, and he 
wonders if our recent experience is telling us to wait.  We are all 
sincerely putting ourselves in the position to be ready.  Colorado Springs
has the social, economic, cultural ethos where many people would never 
think of joining a meeting.  We have had a tough undertaking here as opposed 
to Boulder or Denver.  We are not ready because of some of the things we 
have put in the way.  If we can wait, it might come to us.

`Ginger`_ has heard had a lot of things that resonate for her.  Readiness is 
important; something that we need and something that will serve the Spirit 
through the meeting.  We put down the sense of urgency.  She has thought about
our meeting as the wandering Israelites and makes her wonder if the metaphor 
works on the spiritual level. Do we have the will of God?  And in the season, 
she remembers that work of advent, always preparing for the Christ Child.  
If we are prepared, then the gift will come and we should be ready.  
She reflected on her experience with `IMYM Faith and Practice`_ and talking 
with Charlotte Miller about getting a meetinghouse.  Her sense was that when
they had a meetinghouse, people came and with children.  Might we invite 
friends from Fort Collins and Durango to talk to us about their experience?  
Can we do this and live through our `testimonies`_?  We have reservations.  
When she sat at Fort Collins, she thought, we can do this.

`Genie`_ appreciated `Ginger`_'s sharing.  Should we have an ongoing practice 
of looking for what preparedness looks like?  How do we continue to prepare 
ourselves?  Maybe we need to have a threshing about this.

`Jeremy`_ adds his experience with Salt Lake City.  He pointed out the common 
experience with a overwhelming community.  They found a great place, but 
they are now in the process of struggling to keep it.  Five years out, they 
are having trouble with the mortgage and maintenance.

`Molly`_ commented that the conversation about acquiring a meetinghouse had 
already been excruciating and painful.  Trying to avoid or being afraid of 
difficulty and conflict is not a reason to not have a house.  Also, we have 
gotten the experience of other meetings to build on.  She urged that meeting 
to use other people's efforts prudently. We have used `Ann Daugherty`_'s 
expertise, Brian Murphy's expertise, and the time and expertise of Murphy 
Constructors and several subcontractors.  We need to be aware of the energy 
our efforts have expended, inside and outside of the meeting, when we decide 
to look again.  As a meeting, we agreed to look for a temporary meetinghouse, 
and we found one, but then some members couldn't support it.  That is fine, 
but we need to be aware of how much time, energy and resources such experiments cost.

`Ginger`_ summarized that she hears a willingness to look for a meetinghouse.
She hears, too, that we could benefit from working toward readiness.  She is 
less clear that we should be looking for a property right now.  Should we put 
down searching for right now?

`Bill`_ urged that we relax the attitude that we must pursue the meetinghouse 
as a necessity, but the meeting should encourage those lead to keep going.  The 
feeling of something hanging over us is a impeding the Spirit.  He urges us to
be willing to wait for the building to come to us. 

`Ann Daugherty`_ looks at everything that crosses her desk in terms of whether
or not this will work for us.  

`Carlton`_ asks what we mean by prepare.  For instance, he hears that we keep 
the fund.  Preparation includes doing what we are doing tonight; talking about 
our identity as a meeting. 

`Joyce`_ commented that when we were so close this summer, she was really sold 
on the building but at the same time, if we are meant to get it. We will get it.  
If not, we will learn a lesson from this. So we have to learn how to go about 
this in a different way.  How can we structure of what we want in a building 
with the parameters, so we didn't have to have meetings at the deadline and then 
run out of time. She suggested that the next step to determine the boundaries 
so the searches are not in vain.   

`Ann Daugherty`_ heard the concern about maintenance and she will get numbers 
on life expectancies of parts of the building.

`Ginger`_ suggested that we consider.  
    We are clear that we want to have a meetinghouse and that we need to 
    attend to our spiritual readiness for a meetinghouse.  

We could benefit from discussing the guidelines of the building itself 
again and discussing our process.

`Bill`_ wants to make sure that we attend to the how of things, 
with a focus on our spiritual readiness.

`Linda`_ thinks we should consider land more than we have so far.  

`Ann Daughtery`_ pointed out that we looked at a scraping of a lot. 
She will create a list of options.

`Carlton`_ came back to discussing the how of discussing what we are doing.
`Carlton`_ thinks that we must have a constant interaction with `testimonies`_.  
We can ask more pointedly what does it means to have these `testimonies`_ for this 
meeting.  These conversations will lead to a conversation about what we want in 
a meeting house.  We need to look at these questions collectively.  What does 
it mean to have a meeting that has a simple life?  A whole meeting from this 
standpoint.

`Genie`_ asks if we would, in our search for a space, ever consider renting? 
Would we consider renting a building?  It would deplete our funds.

`Molly`_ said that we have considered it in the past and decided against it so as 
to find an investment.  But that was then.

`Ginger`_ pointed out we could come back to this again.  And she added that we 
might have a series of soup and sharing discussions on the `testimonies`_ as a way 
of preparedness.  

`Bill`_ shared some ideas and background on renting as a bad thing in the old 
days.  Could we think about renting again?

`Molly`_ suggested that we could agree to rent for a set period of time with 
specific goals and see how it goes.

We agreed that we will meet again.

Closed with silence. 

`Ginger`_ sang a song, `Sweet,  Sweet Face`_.
