Finance Committee Meeting Minutes - December 2014

E-Meeting: Sarah Callbeck, Ann Daugherty, and Lisa Beckrich

Cash Flow:  The bank balance is up, as of the end of November, which gives us enough to meet monthly 
obligations, partially replenish Emergency and Sufferings Fund with $50, make distributions to other 
organizations, and meet our yearly pledge of $100 to FGC.

Calculation of Funds Available for Disbursement Monthly details items noted in #1.  We will have a 
sufficient balance at the end of December that drawing on the mortgage reserve will not be necessary.
Savings Update: We are on schedule with reserving for our future obligations.  Emergency & Sufferings 
Fund, after the December allocation, now only needs $100 to replenish it.

Utilities Trend: Usage rose this month, but the cost is still lower than the same period last year by $2.24.

Local Distributions: This month we have $100 to distribute to other local organizations.  The Meeting 
will decide which organizations will benefit.

Budget for 2015: 

1.  Calculated Revenue is based upon $860 pledged per month plus 23% for non-pledged donations. 
    This revenue reflects an adjustment to include postage donated by Treasurer and Finance Clerk 
    which will offset the postage expense in the budget. 

2.  Modifications have been made to expenses in the budget as follows: 

    A.  Supply expenses including cleaning, hospitality, and office have been set to zero.   Friends 

    B.  Advertising expense has been reduced from $175 to $140 to reflect a shorter meeting listing 
        Placed in the Friends Journal. 

    C.  Revisions have been made to Subscriptions. The renewal rate for Friends Journal has been 

    D.  Travel expense has been reduced by 16.67% to bring the net of revenue less expense as 
        may wish to donate items or funds to meet these needs as they arise. 
        updated to $48. Additionally, the renewal rate for Western Friend has been reduced to the 
        "budget" price of $36. 
        close to zero as possible. Disbursements will be made from funds available in Travel 
        Reserve, plus any special donations for travel that have been received at the time a request 
        for assistance is made. 

3.  The 2015 Budget now reflects what the Meeting can spend considering the resources pledged and 
    donations that can reasonably be expected.
